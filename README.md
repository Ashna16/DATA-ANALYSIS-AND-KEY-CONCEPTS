# DATA-ANALYSIS-AND-KEY-CONCEPTS

Fundamentals of Data Analysis:

Data analysis is the process of compiling, processing, and analyzing data so that you can use it to make decisions.
Analytics is the systematic analysis of data. Data analytics is the specific analytical process being applied.
Nowadays, the problem isn't finding the data but it is failing to do something with it.

Data is generated in many ways. The big question is where to put it all and how to use it to create value or generate competitive advantages. The challenges identified in many data analysis solutions can be summarized by five key challenges: volume, velocity, variety, veracity, and value.

COMPONENTS OF DATA ANALYSIS SOLUTION

1. Ingest/Collection : This includes collecting raw data from transactions,logs and IoT devices.These data can be structured or unstructured.
                       A good data analysis allows developers to ingest wide variety of data(Structured,unstructured) at any speed from batch
                       to streaming.

2. Store : A good data analysis solution should provide secure, scalable, and durable storage. This storage should include data stores 
           that can house structured, semistructured, and unstructured data.
           For example, data warehouses efficiently store structured analytical data, databases can store both structured and semistructured           
           data, and data lakes can store all three forms of data.
           
3. Process/analyze : First, data must be processed, transforming it to make the data more consumable. As part of the processing, the     
                     data will also be analyzed. This usually means sorting, aggregating, joining, and applying business logic to produce  
                     meaningful analytical data sets. The final step is to load this analytical data set into a new storage location,like a  
                     data lake, database, or data warehouse.
                     
4. Consume/ visualize : You have two ways to consume data: by querying or by using business intelligence (BI) tools. Querying produces results  
                        that are great for quick analysis by data analysts. Bl tools produce visualizations that are grouped into reports and
                        dashboards to help users explore data and determine the best actions to take.                     

The collect component is where the services assemble data from many sources.
The store component stores data in repositories.
The process component is where services manipulate data into needed forms.
The consume component is where data is presented in the required
